"Kellyanne Conway, President Trump’s counselor and one of his longest-serving and most visible aides, said on Sunday night that she planned to leave the White House next week.In a statement posted on Twitter, Ms. Conway said she was stepping away from a demanding job to spend more time with her four teenage children. “This is completely my choice and my voice,” she said. “In time, I will announce future plans. For now, and for my beloved children, it will be less drama, more mama.”Ms. Conway, who is still set to speak at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday night, told Mr. Trump of her decision to leave on Sunday night in the Oval Office.In a White House famous for its fast revolving door, Ms. Conway’s survival has made her something akin to a tenured official in an otherwise uncertain workplace. She had been in discussions last week with campaign officials about potentially moving from the White House to the campaign, and traveling to two states a day through the election as a surrogate. But she decided that a job on the road would be equally onerous on her family. Her husband, George T. Conway III, a prominent conservative lawyer who has become an outspoken critic of Mr. Trump’s, said Sunday on Twitter that he was stepping back from the anti-Trump group he has been advising, the Lincoln Project. Mr. Conway said he would also take a hiatus from his Twitter account, where he regularly criticizes the president and his aides.The Conways have known Mr. Trump for nearly 15 years, meeting him in New York when he was a real estate developer. In 2011, when Mr. Trump was considering running for president, Ms. Conway, then a pollster with her own company, was one of the people Mr. Trump consulted with about a possible campaign.Since the 2016 campaign, when she served as Mr. Trump’s final campaign manager, Ms. Conway has been one of the president’s most visible defenders, winning his admiration for animated sparring sessions with cable news hosts — and earning criticism and derision from the president’s detractors. Ms. Conway also advised Vice President Mike Pence when he was the governor of Indiana.During her time at the White House, she has asserted herself when other senior administration officials, including Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, and aides who have long since departed, like Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, and Reince Priebus, Mr. Trump’s first chief of staff, have tried to minimize her. She has stepped into the void by helping to shape communications strategy and speaking to reporters when the White House has had few aides willing to defend the president or his policies publicly. Most recently, she has attended all of the coronavirus task force briefings, and encouraged Mr. Trump to restart his daily news conferences.Mr. Trump and his family members have defended Ms. Conway even as her husband, who had initially been tapped for a job in the administration, became an outspoken critic of the president, accusing him regularly of having narcissistic personality disorder. In her statement, Ms. Conway said she and her husband “disagree about plenty but we are united on what matters most: the kids.”Their oldest daughter, Claudia Conway, tweeted on Sunday that she, too, was planning to take a break from social media after attracting national attention for criticizing both of her parents."
"Follow our latest coverage of the Biden vs. Trump 2020 election here.As November draws nearer, some current and former Republican officials have begun to break ranks with the rest of their party, saying in public and private conversations that they will not support President Trump in his re-election. A number have even said that they will be voting for his Democratic opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr.As Mr. Trump’s political standing has slipped, fueled by his failures in handling the coronavirus pandemic and by the economic recession, some Republicans have found it easier to publicly renounce their backing.Here is a running list of those who have said they will support Mr. Biden in the fall, those who simply won’t support Mr. Trump, and those who have hinted they may not back the president. Planning to vote for Biden, or say they are leaning that way John Kasich, the former governor of Ohio: After competing against Mr. Trump in the 2016 Republican primary, Mr. Kasich has never really thrown his support behind the president. But this year, he spoke at the Democratic National Convention and made the case for Mr. Biden.“I’ve known Joe,” Mr. Kasich said on CNN. “I’ve known him for 30 years. I know the kind of guy he is.”Colin Powell, the former secretary of state: Mr. Powell announced in June that he would vote for Mr. Biden. He said that Mr. Trump “lies about things” and that Republicans in Congress would not hold him accountable. Mr. Powell added that he was close to Mr. Biden politically and socially and had worked with him for more than 35 years. He gave a message of support to Mr. Biden at the Democratic convention.Miles Taylor, a former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security: Mr. Taylor endorsed Mr. Biden, saying that the president was “actively doing damage to our security” and that what he had witnessed Mr. Trump do as chief executive “was terrifying.” Mr. Taylor is the most senior former member of the administration to openly endorse Mr. Biden.Christine Whitman, a former governor of New Jersey: Ms. Whitman was one of the few Republicans speaking at the Democratic National Convention. Last October, Ms. Whitman told the television host Larry King that she would vote for Mr. Biden if he were the nominee, calling him the Democrats’ “best chance at winning in 2020.” Meg Whitman, the chief executive of Quibi: A former senior official for both of Mitt Romney’s presidential campaigns and a former Republican candidate for governor of California, Ms. Whitman (no relation to Christine Whitman) also spoke at the Democratic convention. She supported Hillary Clinton in 2016.Susan Molinari, a former congresswoman from New York: Ms. Molinari spoke at the convention, as well. A former lobbyist for Google, she was on the Trump administration’s transition contributor list, but now appears to be supporting Mr. Biden.Carly Fiorina, a 2016 presidential candidate: Ms. Fiorina has said she will support Mr. Biden because he is “a person of humility and empathy and character.”Representative Francis Rooney of Florida: Mr. Rooney has said he was considering supporting Mr. Biden partly because Mr. Trump was “driving us all crazy” and because the president’s handling of the coronavirus led to a death toll that “didn’t have to happen.” Mr. Rooney’s hesitation about Mr. Biden was his worry that left-wing Democrats might pull the former vice president away from the moderate political mainstream. But he does think Mr. Biden can win.“A lot of people that voted for President Trump did so because they did not like Hillary Clinton,” Mr. Rooney said. “I don’t see that happening with Joe Biden — how can you not like Joe Biden?”Charlie Dent, a former congressman from Pennsylvania: Mr. Dent endorsed Mr. Biden on CNN, saying “this isn’t about right or left — for me, it’s about right and wrong.”More than 70 top Republican national security officials: Hours before Mr. Biden accepted the Democratic nomination, the officials released a letter stating that they would be voting for Mr. Biden in November and that Mr. Trump was “unfit to lead.” Among the signatories were former Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel; Michael Hayden, the former C.I.A. and N.S.A. director; John Negroponte, the former director of national intelligence; and William Webster, the former director of the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. Jeff Flake, the former senator from Arizona: Earlier this year, Mr. Flake had said that he would not be supporting Mr. Trump in November, but he is now part of a group of former Republican members of Congress who say they will be voting for Mr. Biden.Gordon Humphrey, the former senator from New Hampshire: In 2017, Mr. Humphrey said that the president was “delusional and unfit to lead.” A member of the “New Hampshire Independents for Biden” coalition, he has endorsed Mr. Biden in November.John Warner, the former senator from Virginia: Mr. Warner, who has been vocal about his dislike of the president since the 2016 election, joined a group of G.O.P. former members of Congress endorsing Mr. Biden on the first morning of the Republican National Convention.Former Representative Steve Bartlett of TexasFormer Representative William Clinger Jr. of PennsylvaniaFormer Representative Tom Coleman of MissouriFormer Representative Charles Djou of Hawaii: Mr. Djou left the Republican Party in 2018 because, he said, Mr. Trump was taking the party in a direction he “fundamentally” disagreed with. He endorsed Mr. Biden the first morning of the Republican convention.Mickey Edwards, a writer and a former Oklahoma congressman: In 2019, Mr. Edwards was part of a group of 19 former G.O.P. members who denounced Mr. Trump’s border wall as “unconstitutional.” Mr. Edwards also officially endorsed Mr. Biden as the Republican convention began.Former Representative Wayne Gilchrest of Maryland: Mr. Gilchrest, who served for nine terms in Congress as a Republican, left the party in 2019. He’s now a registered Democrat endorsing Mr. Biden. Former Representative Jim Greenwood of PennsylvaniaFormer Representative Bob Inglis of South Carolina: Since 2016, Mr. Inglis has been critical about the Trump presidency, especially when it comes to climate change. He has decided to endorse Mr. Biden.Former Representative Jim Kolbe of Arizona: Mr. Kolbe left the Republican Party in 2018, is now registered as an independent and has endorsed Mr. Biden for the fall.Former Representative Steve Kuykendall of CaliforniaFormer Representative Ray LaHood of Illinois: Early this year, Mr. LaHood told The State Journal-Register that he would not be supporting Mr. Trump because the president “was not my kind of politician.” He will be supporting Mr. Biden, he said. Mr. LaHood donated to Mr. Biden’s campaign when the former vice president announced his candidacy.Former Representative Jim Leach of Iowa: Mr. Leach’s endorsement of Mr. Biden isn’t the first time he has supported a Democrat — he publicly endorsed Barack Obama in 2008. It’s also not the first time he has gone against Mr. Trump — he refused to endorse or support him in 2016.Former Representative Connie Morella of MarylandFormer Representative Mike Parker of MississippiFormer Representative Jack Quinn of New YorkFormer Representative Claudine Schneider of Rhode Island: Ms. Schneider backed Mrs. Clinton in 2016, and is again endorsing the Democratic candidate this cycle by backing Mr. Biden.Former Representative Christopher Shays of Connecticut: Last year on “Politicking with Larry King,” Mr. Shays made his case for why he would be supporting Mr. Biden in 2020. Former Representative Peter Smith of VermontFormer Representative Alan Steelman of TexasFormer Representative Jim Walsh of New York: In an interview with The Post-Standard of Syracuse, Mr. Walsh said endorsing Mr. Biden wasn’t a “difficult decision.”“Vice President Biden has an excellent chance to beat this guy. And I think Biden has the qualities and values to clean up this mess that President Trump has gotten us into,” Mr. Walsh added.Former Representative Bill Whitehurst of VirginiaFormer Representative Dick Zimmer of New Jersey: In 2016, Mr. Zimmer endorsed Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate. This time around, he has decided to endorse Mr. Biden.Hundreds of former staff members for John McCain: Over 100 former staff members for Senator John McCain endorsed Mr. Biden in a letter. Most of them are still Republicans. Mark Salter, Mr. McCain’s longtime chief aide and speechwriter, helped organize the letter.Former Mitt Romney alumni: A group known as Romney for Biden issued a statement endorsing Mr. Biden during the Republican National Convention. The group represents nearly every sector of Mr. Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign, and has set up a call inviting other Romney alumni to join it. At the time of this update, over 40 people had signed on.Former Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan: In an opinion article in USA Today, Mr. Snyder said he would be voting for Mr. Biden because “he would bring back civility.”Former Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts: In 2019, after Mr. Weld ended his campaign seeking the Republican presidential nomination against Mr. Trump, he said he would vote for Mr. Biden “in a heartbeat” if he were the nominee. Now he’s part of a coalition working to elect Mr. Biden. Republicans and Independents for Biden: Nearly 100 independents and Republicans have formed a coalition to support Mr. Biden. Led by Christine Whitman, Mr. Weld, Mr. Snyder and others, the group plans to buy ads for Mr. Biden and campaign for him, and will be publishing opinion articles in local and national news outlets in support of the former vice president.Will not support Trump’s re-electionFormer President George W. Bush: Although he has not spoken about whom he will vote for in November, people familiar with Mr. Bush’s thinking have said it won’t be Mr. Trump. Mr. Bush did not endorse him in 2016.Senator Mitt Romney of Utah: Mr. Romney has long been critical of Mr. Trump, and was the only Republican senator to vote to convict him during his impeachment trial. Mr. Romney is still mulling over whom he will vote for in November — he opted for his wife, Ann, four years ago — but he is said to be sure it won’t be the president.John Bolton, the former national security adviser: As he rolled out his recently published book, “The Room Where It Happened,” Mr. Bolton said in multiple interviews that he would not vote for Mr. Trump in November. He added that he would write in the name of a conservative Republican, but that he was not sure which one.Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont: Mr. Scott has said multiple times this summer that he will not be voting for the president, a position that he also took in 2016. He says he has not yet decided whether or not he will vote for Mr. Biden.William H. McRaven, a retired four-star Navy admiral: Several Republican admirals and generals have publicly announced they will not support the president. In an interview with The New York Times, Admiral McRaven, who directed the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, said, “This fall, it’s time for new leadership in this country — Republican, Democrat or independent.”He added, “President Trump has shown he doesn’t have the qualities necessary to be a good commander in chief.” Cindy McCain, the widow of Senator John McCain: During the Democratic National Convention, Mrs. McCain appeared in a video and recounted her husband’s relationship with Mr. Biden. Although she did not endorse Mr. Biden in the video, Mrs. McCain has expressed frustration with the direction of the Republican Party under Mr. Trump, whose attacks on Mr. McCain continued after the senator’s death.Have expressed reluctance or misgivings, but haven’t openly dropped their backing Paul Ryan and John Boehner, the former speakers of the House: Both have expressed their dislike of the president, but have not said whom they will support in November.John Kelly, a former chief of staff to the president: Mr. Kelly has not said whom he plans to vote for, but did say he wished “we had some additional choices.”Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska: She has said that she’s grappling with whether to support Mr. Trump in November. She told reporters on Capitol Hill in June: “I am struggling with it. I have struggled with it for a long time.”She said: “I think right now, as we are all struggling to find ways to express the words that need to be expressed appropriately, questions about who I’m going to vote for or not going to vote for, I think, are distracting at the moment. I know people might think that’s a dodge, but I think there are important conversations that we need to have as an American people among ourselves about where we are right now.”Mark Sanford, a former congressman and governor of South Carolina: Mr. Sanford briefly challenged the president in this cycle’s Republican primary, and said last year that he would support Mr. Trump if the president won the nomination (which was never in doubt). That has since changed.“He’s treading on very thin ice,” Mr. Sanford said in June, worrying that the president is threatening the stability of the country.Dan Coats, a former senator from Indiana: Mr. Coats, who used to be Mr. Trump’s director of intelligence, is worried about the administration’s effects on the intelligence community. He hasn’t said whom he will support. Kevin Kellems, a longtime adviser to Mr. Coats, said that “ultimately he remains a loyal Republican, but he believes the American people will decide on Nov. 3.”Maggie Haberman contributed reporting."
"Bucking tradition, a group of climate activists has won three seats in an election to an important governing body at Harvard University, the Board of Overseers, the university announced Friday.The slate of candidates ran on a platform that included calls for the university to drop fossil fuel investments from its portfolio, part of a divestment movement that has swept college campuses for the better part of a decade.Harvard, with an endowment of more than $40 billion, has resisted those calls. In April, the university’s president, Lawrence Bacow, said that divestment “paints with too broad a brush” and instead announced that Harvard was setting a course to become greenhouse-gas neutral by 2050, a move that he correctly predicted would not satisfy those seeking total divestment.Candidates for the six-year terms on the board are customarily nominated through the Harvard Alumni Association. These candidates were elected through a petition campaign, the first to successfully do so since 1989, when a group seeking divestment from South Africa put forward Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Three of the 2020 slate’s five candidates gained seats on the 30-person board: Jayson Toweh, Margaret Purce and Thea Sebastian. While the overseers have no direct control over the endowment, they have influence in setting the university’s priorities.In a statement, Harvard Forward, the group behind the slate, said that the alumni, faculty members and students they worked with were “thrilled at the victory and hope it will send a clear message to Harvard that it must take more urgent action on these issues.”The president of the Board of Overseers, R. Martin Chávez, said, “All of us on the Board welcome this year’s new Overseers,” in a statement published by the university. “These are extraordinary times, posing extraordinary challenges, and the Board will do all we can to help Harvard navigate them as thoughtfully as possible, always with an overriding concern for the best interests of the University and how it can best serve the world.”The election had become tense at times, with the alumni leaders arguing that the insurgents had “copious funding” and were “pushing their own single-issue or multi-issue agendas, special interests, or political viewpoints.” Gay Seidman, a professor of sociology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who was the first person who ran by petition to win a Harvard Board of Overseers election, and who campaigned on an anti-apartheid divestment platform in 1986, said she had not expected to win; instead, she said, she saw the candidacy as “a way to start conversations about what’s an acceptable business practice.”She said she would warn the members of the new slate that “change happens really slowly in institutions that are as complicated as universities,” but that “if you think of the goal as to start conversations, then they have already won.”And, she added, “they should look forward to many discussions of how much office space the math department really needs.”"
"Greenland lost a record amount of ice in 2019, researchers reported Thursday. Nearly half of it was lost in July, when the region roasted from an unusual heat wave.The net ice loss of more than 530 billion metric tons was more than twice the annual average since 2003, the scientists said. In July, when warm air from Europe moved north, leading to temperatures that were well above normal and causing widespread surface melting of the ice sheet, the loss was roughly equal to the average loss in a full year.Ingo Sasgen, a geoscientist at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany, and the lead author of a paper describing the findings in the journal Communications and Environment, said with the warmth last summer, he and his colleagues suspected that 2019 would be a bad one for the ice sheet.They analyzed data from a pair of satellites that precisely measure the gravitational pull, and thus the mass, of the area they are orbiting over. “It took us some time to analyze it and quantify it robustly, but it turned out to be another record melt year,” Dr. Sasgen said. In the previous record year, 2012, the net loss was about 460 billion metric tons.Yara Mohajerani, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Washington who was not involved in the study, said it was “part of a series of studies that have shown the same thing,” including work that he did that reported record ice loss in summer 2019..css-1xzcza9{list-style-type:disc;padding-inline-start:1em;}.css-1wxds7f{margin-bottom:10px;font-family:nyt-franklin,helvetica,arial,sans-serif;font-weight:700;font-size:0.875rem;line-height:1.25rem;color:#333 !important;}.css-1yyoic1{font-family:nyt-franklin,helvetica,arial,sans-serif;font-size:0.9375rem;line-height:1.25rem;color:#333;margin-bottom:0.78125rem;}@media (min-width:740px){.css-1yyoic1{font-size:1.0625rem;line-height:1.5rem;margin-bottom:0.9375rem;}}.css-zkk2wn{margin-bottom:20px;font-family:nyt-franklin,helvetica,arial,sans-serif;font-size:0.875rem;line-height:1.5625rem;color:#333;}.css-1dvfdxo{margin:10px auto 0px;font-family:nyt-franklin,helvetica,arial,sans-serif;font-weight:700;font-size:1.125rem;line-height:1.5625rem;color:#121212;}@media (min-width:740px){.css-1dvfdxo{font-size:1.25rem;line-height:1.875rem;}}#masthead-bar-one{display:none;}#masthead-bar-one{display:none;}.css-19mumt8{background-color:white;margin:30px 0;padding:0 20px;max-width:510px;}@media (min-width:740px){.css-19mumt8{margin:40px auto;}}.css-19mumt8:focus{outline:1px solid #e2e2e2;}.css-19mumt8 a{color:#326891;-webkit-text-decoration:none;text-decoration:none;border-bottom:2px solid #ccd9e3;}.css-19mumt8 a:visited{color:#333;-webkit-text-decoration:none;text-decoration:none;border-bottom:2px solid #ddd;}.css-19mumt8 a:hover{border-bottom:none;}.css-19mumt8[data-truncated] .css-rdoyk0{-webkit-transform:rotate(0deg);-ms-transform:rotate(0deg);transform:rotate(0deg);}.css-19mumt8[data-truncated] .css-eb027h{max-height:300px;overflow:hidden;-webkit-transition:none;transition:none;}.css-19mumt8[data-truncated] .css-5gimkt:after{content:'See more';}.css-19mumt8[data-truncated] .css-6mllg9{opacity:1;}.css-a8d9oz{border-top:5px solid #121212;border-bottom:2px solid #121212;margin:0 auto;padding:5px 0 0;overflow:hidden;}Climate and Environment ›Keep Up on the Latest Climate NewsUpdated Sept. 10, 2020Here’s what you need to know this week:The wildfires scorching the West highlight the urgency of rethinking fire management policies, as climate change threatens to make things worse.Americans back tough limits on building in fire and flood zones, new research shows.The Trump administration has relaxed Obama-era rules limiting the release of toxic waste from coal plants.""use strict"";var modal=document.getElementById(""prism-freeform-block-39998""),button=document.getElementById(""prism-freeform-button-39998"");button&&button.addEventListener(""click"",function(){var a=modal.toggleAttribute(""data-truncated"");a?(button.scrollIntoView(),window.scrollBy(0,-80)):modal.focus()});var titleEl=document.getElementsByClassName(""css-1dvfdxo""),surveyEl=document.getElementById(""styln-survey-component-39998""),parentDomain=window.location.href,message={componentName:surveyEl&&surveyEl.dataset&&surveyEl.dataset.surveyname,componentQuestion:""Was this helpful?"",storylineName:surveyEl&&surveyEl.dataset&&surveyEl.dataset.surveystoryline,id:""styln-survey-component-39998""};parent.postMessage(message,parentDomain);Greenland’s ice sheet is nearly two miles thick in places, and if all the ice were to melt, sea levels would rise about 24 feet, or about 7.5 meters.That would take centuries. But since the 1990s, as the Arctic has warmed faster than any other part of the planet, ice loss from Greenland and its contribution to sea level rise have accelerated. At the current rate of loss, Greenland’s ice accounts for about one-quarter inch per decade of the global total increase of about one and a quarter inches per decade. But ice loss can vary from year to year. In their paper, Dr. Sasgen and his colleagues found that net loss in 2017 and 2018 was about half the annual average since 2003.So far in 2020, he said, net ice loss appears to be a little below average.Both 2017 and 2018 had colder-than-usual summers, Dr. Sasgen said, when cold air flowed from the north along the west coast of Greenland, reducing ice loss. But in 2019 that circulation pattern was reversed, with warm air coming from the south. Similar reversals have happened before. “It was really fascinating that it jumped again from very cold historic conditions to a record melt year,” he said.The shift to north-flowing air occurs when a region of high-pressure air, a result of changes in the jet stream, lingers over Greenland. Referred to as a “block,” these zones of stationary air have become more frequent in the Arctic, and while there is debate as to why, many scientists are increasingly seeing a link to global warming that is made worse by sea-ice loss in the Arctic Ocean.“It’s very clear that the last 10, 15, 20 years have produced more stationary wave patterns and more blocking situations over Greenland,” Dr. Sasgen said. “There’s a very likely chance it’s connected to sea-ice loss. But it’s really hard to prove.” In Greenland, ice loss results from runoff of surface meltwater and from discharge of ice from glaciers that serve as outlets for the ice sheet, connecting it to the ocean. Accumulation results from snowfall that, compressed over years, eventually becomes ice. When runoff and discharge exceed accumulation, the result is net loss.A paper published last week in the same journal showed that ice discharge from outlet glaciers, which includes both calving of icebergs and underwater melting, had increased by about 14 percent since the 1980s.Most of the increase was from 2000 to 2005, and discharge rates have remained relatively consistent at this higher level since then, said the study’s lead author, Michalea King, who recently earned her doctorate from Ohio State University and will soon be a researcher at the University of Washington.The increase in ice discharge, coupled with the trend toward increasing meltwater runoff over the past several decades, make it increasingly unlikely that Greenland will have years with a net ice gain, Dr. King said.“It’s kind of a double whammy,” she said. “Only one of every 100 years would we expect to have mass gain.”The new paper, which Dr. King contributed to, illustrates that point, she said. While the abnormal cold summers of 2017 and 2018 led to more ice accumulation and less surface melt runoff, “even with all of that they’re still mass-loss years,” she said, largely because of the higher glacier discharge rate.“Mass loss is not going away anytime soon,” Dr. King said. “But of course we have control over the rate"" by taking steps to mitigate climate change.“It’s not a throw-your-hands-up kind of situation,” she said."
"People generally adore Google for bringing useful technology to the masses at an aggressively low price, if not free.For those who like that, I have happy news: Google is getting really, really good at the price cutting, while still bringing quality, with its smartphones.The evidence? The Pixel 4A smartphone, which the company introduced on Monday.With this latest device, Google took the best stuff from its $800 high-end Pixel 4 — specifically, an excellent camera system and a large, bright screen — and squeezed it into the body of a $350 device. That’s $50 less than last year’s Pixel 3A, which was Google’s first budget phone.The Pixel 4A is cheaper than high-end devices largely because it lacks the frills in fancy phones, like wireless charging and a face scanner. But for what you pay, it’s a great value. Its camera quality and bright screen are on a par with many of the best smartphones out there. Like the $399 iPhone SE, which Apple released in April, the Pixel 4A is a sign that you no longer need to pay through the nose for a great smartphone with a nice camera.Carolina Milanesi, a consumer technology analyst for Creative Strategies, a consulting firm, said Google’s prowess in software was helping bring down the price of premium smartphone technology.“It’s been a long time coming for this market, which has always been focused on the high end because of the dominance of Samsung and the iPhone,” she said.I tested the Pixel 4A for two weeks, including comparing it against the budget iPhone. Here’s what I found.Focusing on What We Care AboutGoogle, which prides itself on being driven by data, surveyed its customers to find out what they wanted in a smartphone. A large screen, long battery life, lots of storage and great camera quality were among the features that people cared most about. For the most part, that’s what you get with the Pixel 4A. Let’s run through its features:The screen measures 5.81 diagonal inches and relies on OLED (organic light-emitting diode) technology, a newer type of display that can be made thinner, lighter and brighter with better color accuracy and contrast than its predecessor, LCD, or liquid crystal display. For a device in this price range, this is a very roomy, attractive display, with nice colors and deep shadow detail.Its colors aren’t as accurate as the screen on Apple’s $999 iPhone 11 Pro, which is nearly identical in size, but at this price, I can’t complain.The 4A has a reasonably long battery life, though your mileage may depend on what you do. On a typical workday juggling emails, calls and texts, I had more than 30 percent battery life left in the evening. But on weekends, when I had downtime, playing games and watching videos with the 4A drained the battery in a few hours. This is typical of smartphones.The 4A comes in only one model with a generous amount of storage: 128 gigabytes, which is enough for most casual users to store thousands of photos and lots of apps and games. This was a wise decision by Google. Whenever I talk to people about their tech problems, running out of storage on their phone is a frequent complaint.Pixel phones are famous for their camera system, which has software features powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning. The Pixel 4A has Google’s most important camera features, including Portrait mode, also known as the bokeh effect, which puts a picture’s main subject in sharp focus while gently blurring the background. It also offers Night Sight, which makes photos taken in low light look as if they had been shot in normal conditions, without a flash.The 4A lacks some features that were in the Pixel 4 — such as wireless charging and a face scanner for unlocking the phone. That’s not a dealbreaker for a device this cheap.But Google left out one big feature that does matter: water resistance. That would save a phone that was accidentally dunked in a toilet or left out in a storm. So it was disappointing not to have it because durability was another feature that people wanted most in their smartphones.The company left out water resistance because it put priority on other features while reducing the price from last year’s Pixel 3A, a Google spokesman said.Pixel Versus iPhoneThe 4A’s strengths and weaknesses are best illustrated in a side-by-side comparison with Apple’s iPhone SE. Here’s a rundown of where each one came out on top.Camera Winner: Pixel 4A. Though both phone cameras produced very clear, satisfying photos in bright light, the Pixel’s camera was slightly better than the iPhone’s camera. That was partly because of the Pixel’s ability to take photos in low light, a feature that is useful in some situations, like a family photo inside a dimly lit restaurant. ScreenWinner: Pixel 4A. The Google phone’s screen is notably larger than the iPhone’s, which measures 4.7 diagonal inches and uses older, dimmer-looking LCD screen technology. PowerWinner: Pixel 4A. On average, after a day of heavy use, the Pixel 4A had plenty of battery left by the evening. The iPhone SE’s battery was usually almost empty by supper time. (Unlike the Pixel 4A, the iPhone SE does have wireless charging, which is not a must-have feature.)DurabilityWinner: iPhone SE. The Apple phone is water and dust resistant. That’s a major benefit for budget-conscious consumers who want their phone to last many years.PerformanceWinner: iPhone SE. Gaming and web browsing are noticeably smoother on the budget iPhone. The Apple handset uses the same mobile computing processor as the one found in Apple’s high-end phones, which is the fastest on the market. People who plan to use their phone heavily for work tasks may prefer the iPhone.StorageWinner: Pixel 4A. The iPhone SE starts at $399 with 64 gigabytes, a modest amount of storage that can be quickly gobbled up if you take lots of photos. To get an iPhone SE that matches the 128 gigabytes in the Pixel 4A, you would have to shell out $449.The Bottom LineBoth the budget Pixel and Apple phones are excellent values. Some may prefer the Pixel 4A for its richer set of features, while others may choose the iPhone for its greater longevity.What’s clear is that the tech giants are now aggressively competing to offer bang-for-the-buck phones. For several years, especially after the introduction of the $999 iPhone X in 2017, it felt as if phone prices were only going up. It’s a relief that the Pixel 4A is not only better than its predecessor but also cheaper. So why would you spend $800 for the Pixel 4 if the Pixel 4A, for less than half the price, is also very good minus some superfluous features?The clear answer: Only gadget enthusiasts should have to pay a premium for cutting-edge tech.The rest of us now have the option to save."
"Long before the internet made it easy to share the nuances of daily life, local newspapers and other regional publications reported the business, society and civic news of the people in the community. For budding genealogists, finding an ancestor in an old microfilmed newspaper and reading contemporaneous accounts of her turn in the school play or his all-city bowling championship provide a glimpse into the past that’s more textured than a chart of names and dates.Taking a more narrative approach to the family story can be a time-consuming detective project with no guaranteed results. But once you have a name and know when and where the person lived, you can start your quest to find out how they lived. Here’s how to get started.Digging Up Your RootsIf you’re just beginning to climb your family tree and need names on the branches, a subscription service like Ancestry or MyHeritage can be an easy place to start gathering information. In addition to billions of digitized records (like census data, draft rolls and religious registries), these services include tutorials, articles, message boards and other tools to help learn you learn how to find your people.ImageLarge subscription genealogy services like Ancestry host billions of historical records from the National Archives and elsewhere that you can search.Credit...The New York TimesWhen you get some names pinned to your tree, you may also start to receive hints of possible undiscovered relatives from the site’s algorithms or the service’s other members to help you along. If you’re not sure you want to commit to a regular subscription fee, look for a free trial period. Finding Alternative ResourcesSleuthing on a budget? Visit the National Archives site and its “Resources for Genealogists” page for links to information on finding land records, immigration and naturalization documents, census data, military-service papers, and more. While not all government records may be free or digitized, the National Archives hosts a page of links from other genealogy sites where you can look for information. Some ancestors are harder to trace than others. For families severed by slavery or overlooked by government, the site has an Ethnic Heritage section with tips for finding African-American ancestors, as well as for those searching for Chinese, Hispanic/Latino, Japanese or Native American forebears.FamilySearch, run by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, requires only a free account to search its billions of historical records. Geni.com (owned by MyHeritage) has free basic family-tree building services and a large social community that encourages members to work together. Immigration museums may also have free online databases, like the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation Passenger Search. Diving Into the ArchivesOnce you have pinned your ancestors to specific places and years, look for local media from that time. Business dealings, town government activity, social gatherings and obituaries were often reported in 19th- and 20th-century papers. But be warned: In addition to sometimes florid writing, articles from certain eras and areas can be rife with the unchecked misogyny, racism and xenophobia of the day.The Newspaper Archives, Indexes and Morgues section of the Library of Congress site has links to many digitized publications, including African-American, Cherokee and Mexican-American newspapers.The Ancestor Hunt genealogy site has a section devoted to finding historical newspapers online, and the Elephind site lets you search a growing collection of digitized international newspapers. Some archives are free, some charge to view the microfilmed images, and search capabilities vary. Newspapers.com is an archive with more than 17,000 digitized publications dating from the 1700s. After the free trial, subscriptions start at about $8 a month, but you can search, clip, save and print the articles you find.Finding Further ReadingLibraries and historical/genealogical societies may also have books and periodicals that recorded the development of the area and the people who lived there, although you may have to visit in person to look at the original material if it has not been scanned. (Some libraries also offer free access to the commercial genealogy services.)ImageIf your family has been tied to an area for generations, you may be able to find your forebears in a local history book that has been digitized by Google or an independent archivist.Credit...The New York Times As settlements grew, local historians often wrote books that chronicled that development and its founding families. Many of these volumes are now digitized in the public domain; search Google Books or the Internet Archive for the town or county in question.Your relatives may also appear in the vital records bureaus of the states where they lived. The RootsWeb site offers tips on searching in its Red Book collection of American state, county and town resources. And finally, if burial was the family tradition, try the Find a Grave site, a searchable database of cemeteries; like Newspapers.com, it’s owned by Ancestry. The site is still growing and often includes published obituaries and photos of grave sites so you can remotely visit and see where your ancestors ultimately landed."
"While some people escape into big adventure movies and romantic comedies, others prefer the cathartic release of make-believe terror. Horror has thrived on our screens since the silent era, and has adapted to the times and audiences — and modes of distribution, from spooky stories told by candlelight to graphic gore piped to a tablet.Here is a survey of the horror offerings from the main streaming services. (Note that except for streaming originals, titles are on a rolling basis and can appear or disappear overnight.)Amazon Prime Video Subscribers to Amazon Prime have a bulging vault at their fingertips. You will easily locate, for instance, such recent favorites as Luca Guadagnino’s remake of “Suspiria,” and Ari Aster’s “Hereditary” and “Midsommar.” But the real pleasures come from digging deeper. Oh, the scary places you’ll go: from the silent “Nosferatu” (it still works) to the Roman Polanski “is she or isn’t she?” classic “Rosemary’s Baby” and the underrated B-movie “The Crazies,” in which Timothy Olyphant battles the titular zombielike hordes. The sheer abundance can be overwhelming, but inquisitiveness is rewarded.And there is more to come: Amazon recently announced an eight-film co-producing deal with Blumhouse Productions, the company behind “Insidious” and “Get Out.”HBO Max HBO Max’s comparatively small horror selection is well curated, which means you won’t have to sift through dozens of abysmal titles to find gold nuggets. For completists who like to gobble up franchises, the platform’s catalog reads like a twisted cover of “The 12 Days of Christmas”: the first four “Alien” thrillers, the first two “Hostel” chillers, four “Jaws” sightings, five “Nightmare on Elm Street” outings, seven “Leprechaun” movies leaping, eight vintage “Godzilla” films stomping.Looking to catch up on influential classics? HBO has David Lynch’s “Eraserhead,” William Friedkin’s “The Exorcist” and Georges Franju’s “Eyes Without a Face,” whose impact has not dimmed 60 years after its release. All in all, this platform will give horror newbies a solid base, while advanced students will find many films (and series like “Lovecraft Country”) to nibble on. Hulu Hulu does not have a huge horror catalog and mostly focuses on recent releases. Still, the platform is a haven for viewers who want to be scared but either don’t have the stomach for ultraviolence or prefer art-house stylings: think “A Quiet Place,” “The Cabin in the Woods,” the harrowing “The Nightingale” or the still-upsetting “Hellraiser” (from 1987, which qualifies as vintage on Hulu). Worth adding to your queue are two excellent subtitled spins on major subgenres: the Swedish “Let the Right One In” (vampires) and the Vietnamese “The Housemaid” (ghost story).Finally, Hulu streams all nine seasons of “American Horror Story,” as opposed to Netflix and Amazon Prime’s eight.Netflix The streaming behemoth does not have the most high-profile horror films; it just has a lot of horror films, most of them no older than 10 or 15 years. Noteworthy titles include “The Witch,” “Sinister” and the influential likes of “Poltergeist,” “Candyman” and “Paranormal Activity.”Netflix has also brought in worthy originals like the cult favorite “The Platform,” a pitch-dark Spanish science fiction allegory that will make you think twice before chowing down on your next meal; the French Canadian “Ravenous,” a superlative take on the zombie apocalypse; and the Stephen King adaptation “Gerald’s Game,” led by a brilliant Carla Gugino. (Other King adaptations on Netflix include “1922,” the 2002 remake of “Carrie” and the series inspired by “The Mist.”) Finally, Netflix has also delivered two series that are well worth a look: the subtly spooky “The Haunting of Hill House” and “Black Summer,” a fantastic take on the zombie-outbreak genre. (“Stranger Things” has horror elements but is more of a science fiction thriller. Feel free to disagree.)Shudder Owned by AMC Networks, Shudder is a niche service best for those who have already seen most of the horror classics — though if you haven’t, it has the original versions of “Night of the Living Dead,” “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” and “Halloween.”For more rarefied experiences, the international section has quite a few blood-soaked goodies: the Italian gore master Lucio Fulci’s “Zombie” and “City of the Living Dead,” the brutal French survival tale “Revenge” and the new Guatemalan critical darling “La Llorona.”In terms of series, Zachary Quinto shines as an evil soul-eating being in AMC’s supernatural “NOS4A2.” The stylish Shudder original “Deadwax,” about a vinyl LP that kills those who listen to it, loses steam as it goes along, but the first four (of eight) episodes are stellar — and they are only 15 minutes long. Speaking of cursed media: You can pair “Deadwax” with Hideo Nakata’s J-horror classic “Ring,” about a killer videotape.Sure, Shudder has quite a few bottom-of-the-barrel picks (who doesn’t?), but it is high class compared to its competitor Screambox, which relies heavily on microbudget exploitation flicks (sample fare: “Virgin Cheerleaders in Chains,” “Dimension Z”)."
"WASHINGTON — In early February, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin invited two Republican members of the Postal Service’s board of governors to his office to update him on a matter in which he had taken a particular interest — the search for a new postmaster general.Mr. Mnuchin had made clear before the meeting that he wanted the governors to find someone who would push through the kind of cost-cutting and price increases that President Trump had publicly called for and that Treasury had recommended in a December 2018 report as a way to stem years of multibillion-dollar losses.It was an unusual meeting at an unusual moment.Since 1970, the Postal Service had been an independent agency, walled off from political influence. The postmaster general is not appointed by the president and is not a cabinet member. Instead, the postal chief is picked by a board of governors, with seats reserved for members of both parties, who are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate for seven-year terms.Now, not only was the Trump administration, through Mr. Mnuchin, involving itself in the process for selecting the next postmaster general, but the two Democratic governors who were then serving on the board were not invited to the Treasury meeting. Since the meeting did not include a quorum of board members, it was not subject to sunshine laws that apply to official board meetings and there is no formal Postal Service record or minutes of what was discussed. Nearly six months later, that meeting, along with other interactions between Mr. Mnuchin and the postal board, has taken on heightened significance as the Trump administration confronts allegations it sought to politicize the Postal Service and hinder its ability to handle a surge in mail-in ballots in November’s election. In interviews, documents and congressional testimony, Mr. Mnuchin emerges as a key player in selecting the board members who hired the Trump megadonor now leading the Postal Service and in pushing the agenda that he has pursued.Mr. Trump’s animus toward the agency dates to at least 2013, but his criticism of its finances escalated once he took office and found new focus in late 2017, when he first bashed it for essentially subsidizing Amazon, another target of his ire. Amazon’s founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post, whose coverage has often angered Mr. Trump.“This Post Office scam must stop. Amazon must pay real costs (and taxes) now!” the president wrote on Twitter on March 31, 2018, one of several such attacks over the years.Twelve days later, he issued an executive order putting Mr. Mnuchin in charge of a postal reform task force. But it was not until earlier this year that the administration found a way to enforce its postal agenda — one that has now collided with the pandemic and the approaching election.A few weeks after the February meeting with Mr. Mnuchin, one of the attendees, Robert M. Duncan, the chairman of the board of governors, who was appointed by Mr. Trump in 2017, threw a new name for postmaster general into the mix: Louis DeJoy. Mr. DeJoy, a longtime logistics executive, was known for his hard-charging leadership style and his ability to convert disorganization into efficiency, as well his generous donations to the Republican Party, including to Mr. Trump. In October 2017, Mr. DeJoy had hosted a fund-raiser for the president’s re-election campaign at his North Carolina home.His résumé was far different than recent postmasters general, most of whom had risen through the Postal Service ranks. Megan J. Brennan, who had announced in October 2019 her intention to retire as postmaster general at the end of January, began her career as a letter carrier in Pennsylvania. Mr. DeJoy, who ran New Breed Logistics before selling it to XPO Logistics in 2014, would be coming from the private sector to assume control of a highly unionized, sprawling bureaucracy with more than half a million employees. His companies had experience working with the Postal Service, moving bulk shipments of packages from fulfillment centers and ferrying them to local Postal Service centers. But both companies had fewer than 10,000 employees, none of them unionized, and he had never worked in the public sector.The companies were also the subject of a litany of complaints from workers, including more than a dozen lawsuits accusing managers — but not Mr. DeJoy personally — of presiding over a hostile environment rife with sexual harassment and racial discrimination and where workers were fired for getting sick or injured. The board’s vice chairman at the time, David C. Williams, raised concerns about Mr. DeJoy’s candidacy and Mr. Mnuchin’s involvement, telling lawmakers during sworn testimony this week that he “didn’t strike me as a serious candidate.” Mr. Williams, a Democratic appointee, resigned before the vote as it became clear that Mr. DeJoy would be the pick.Three months after the meeting in Mr. Mnuchin’s office, the board of governors announced Mr. DeJoy’s selection as the nation’s 75th postmaster general. Within weeks, he began carrying out changes, including cuts to overtime and limiting mail delivery trips. He curtailed postal hours and mandated that carriers must adhere to a rigid schedule. A July memo from the Postal Service warned that the changes might temporarily result in “mail left behind or mail on the workroom floor or docks.” The measures matched up with recommendations in the task force report, which blamed the Postal Service for losing billions because of waste, inefficiency and a failure to respond to declining mail volumes.But the rapid-fire moves just months before the November election concerned Postal Service insiders, who said that, since at least the Obama administration, the agency had generally sought to avoid significant changes within two or three months of a general election.Soon, mail was piling up at post offices, veterans were not receiving their medications, bills were arriving late and questions began surfacing about the ability of the Postal Service to handle what is expected to be a record number of mail-in ballots this November because of the pandemic.Amid an outcry from lawmakers, civil rights groups and state officials, Mr. DeJoy suspended many of the changes on Tuesday, including some that had been underway before he took the helm of the Postal Service. Yet he made clear during a Senate hearing on Friday that he planned to move ahead with “dramatic” measures after the election, including raising prices and limiting overtime.Postal Service employees and union officials say significant damage has already been done. Hundreds of mail-sorting machines have been removed, and the day-to-day changes have caused confusion and delays among drivers, carriers and other workers.In his Senate testimony on Friday, Mr. DeJoy chalked that up to growing pains as the organization tries to get leaner. “We all feel, you know, bad” he told lawmakers upset about mail delays affecting their constituents. Mr. DeJoy stressed that the changes had nothing to do with the election and noted that the removal of mailboxes and sorting machines had begun before his tenure. He said that he had been unaware of the equipment removal until it became a source of scrutiny. “This has been going on in every election year, and every year, for that matter,” he said, adding that he had “no idea” that it was happening. Kevin Tabarus, a local president of the mail handlers’ union, questioned Mr. DeJoy’s qualifications and the selection process. “The guy has been to way more Republican fund-raisers than post offices,” he said, emphasizing just how delayed some of the mail has been under Mr. DeJoy’s watch.After the task force issued its report, Mr. Mnuchin sought to ensure that the president nominated postal governors who would enact Treasury’s recommendations and would pick a like-minded postmaster general to carry them out. Mr. Mnuchin referred prospective candidates to the White House, according to a Treasury spokeswoman, and then regularly asked his staff for updates, a former Treasury official involved in the process said.Over the last two years, Mr. Mnuchin met privately on multiple occasions about postal matters with Mr. Duncan, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee who was confirmed by the Senate as a postal board member in August 2018, according to people familiar with the meetings.Mr. Mnuchin also arranged a meeting with John M. Barger, a California lawyer and financial investment adviser who was recommended to the Treasury secretary by a mutual associate who knew of Mr. Barger’s work as chairman of the board of the Los Angeles County pension fund. After a meeting in Washington, Mr. Mnuchin recommended that Mr. Trump appoint Mr. Barger to the board of governors.Mr. Barger was confirmed by the Senate last summer, and was tapped to lead the committee to select a new postmaster general. He attended the February meeting in Mr. Mnuchin’s office with Mr. Duncan.S. David Fineman, a former member and chairman of the Postal Service’s board, called Mr. Mnuchin’s close involvement in the affairs of the Postal Service “absolutely unprecedented.” During his tenure in the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, he said the board had minimal interaction with the administrations, and “certainly no communication regarding the hiring of the postmaster general.”The board hired two search firms to assist in the selection process by conducting a nationwide search. One of them, Russell Reynolds Associates, compiled a database of prospective candidates and provided a subset of dozens of names it deemed most promising to the board.Mr. DeJoy’s name was not among those initially provided, according to people familiar with the process. But Mr. Duncan raised Mr. DeJoy’s name during a discussion among board members about other prospective candidates. Mr. Duncan, who has been involved in a super PAC that supports Mr. Trump’s re-election, had met Mr. DeJoy through Mr. DeJoy’s wife, Aldona Wos. Both had been appointed by Mr. Trump to help lead the President’s Commission on White House Fellowships.After the board received a readout from Russell Reynolds, which indicated that Mr. DeJoy was already in the firm’s database and was qualified, Mr. Barger went to lunch with Mr. DeJoy to assess his interest in, and suitability for, the post.Mr. Barger was impressed, and reported his impressions to the full board the same day. “It’s uncommon to find somebody from outside the Postal Service who also has a history of success working with the Postal Service,” Mr. Barger said in an interview on Friday.Nearly two months after the meeting in Mr. Mnuchin’s office about the search process, Mr. Duncan wrote a follow-up letter to the Treasury secretary indicating that the board had “narrowed the search to a small number of finalists, each of whom would serve the country well.”Mr. Barger rejected suggestions that Mr. Mnuchin was playing politics with the Postal Service, noting that Democratic governors had met with top Treasury officials under Mr. Mnuchin. Mr. Mnuchin was not involved in the board’s decision to select Mr. DeJoy, Mr. Barger said, adding that the board “viewed Secretary Mnuchin as a stakeholder who was doing his job in having an interest in how our process was moving forward, but certainly nothing more than that.” A Treasury spokeswoman acknowledged that Mr. Mnuchin urged the board to act expeditiously to find a new postmaster general when Ms. Brennan announced her retirement. The spokeswoman noted that Postal Service board members are part of the executive branch and that, as the head of the postal reform task force, Mr. Mnuchin had a right to be involved in the selection process and interview board candidates.On Friday, the Treasury Department released a “fact sheet” to rebut allegations that have been leveled at Mr. Mnuchin in recent days, including that he politicized the Postal Service and used the department’s role as its lender to leverage influence over postal policies.The department denied that Mr. Mnuchin had a role in selecting Mr. DeJoy and said his contact with board members was part of his “normal course of fulfilling his obligations” as chairman of the Federal Financing Bank, which lends money to the Postal Service and other federal agencies, and the presidential postal task force that produced the 2018 report. Mr. DeJoy, 63, had transformed his father’s Long Island trucking company from a small shop with 10 employees into a national logistics and supply-chain provider that won lucrative contracts with Boeing, Verizon and the Postal Service. By 2014, around the time that he sold it XPO for $615 million, the company had about 7,000 employees.That kind of growth came at a cost. In the logistics industry, speed is supreme. New Breed Logistics competed with Amazon in the hustle to deliver products to people’s homes as fast as possible. In pursuit of that goal, New Breed Logistics pushed their workers to extremes, according to a New York Times investigation published in 2018.The company’s warehouse in Memphis offered a glimpse into the grueling culture that played out under Mr. DeJoy’s leadership. Inside the warehouse, hundreds of workers, many of them women, lifted and dragged boxes that could weigh up to 45 pounds. To save money, there was no air-conditioning, even in the middle of southern summers, causing temperatures to rise past 100 degrees. Employees at the warehouse were disciplined using a “point system,” in which they could be fired once they racked up 10 points. Asking for a break to go to the doctor could earn you a point, as could taking too long on a break.In 2013, New Breed was ordered to pay $1.5 million after the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued, accusing the company of retaliating against three female employees who said they had been sexually harassed.There was no reprieve for women who were pregnant or sick, according to interviews and lawsuits. Those who asked for lighter work loads were often denied. That included women like Tasha Murrell, who pleaded with her supervisor in 2014 to leave early because she was pregnant and lifting had become unbearable. Instead of a reprieve, her supervisor told her to get an abortion, according to a discrimination complaint that she later filed with the employment commission. Shortly after asking for a break, Ms. Murrell woke up in a pool of her own blood. She rushed to the hospital, where she learned that she had miscarried.“It was like a sweatshop,” Ms. Murrell said. “All they cared about was their profits.”XPO declined to comment for this article. A spokeswoman previously told The Times the company was “surprised by the allegations of conduct that either predate XPO’s acquisition of the Memphis facility or weren’t reported to management after we acquired it in 2014.”During his testimony on Friday, Mr. DeJoy said he spoke to Mr. Mnuchin during discussions about the terms of a loan that the Postal Service was receiving as part of the virus economic relief legislation. He said that they did not discuss his operational plans in “grave detail.” “I told him I was working on a plan,” Mr. DeJoy said, explaining that he had mentioned improving service and gaining “cost efficiencies.”Mr. DeJoy and Mr. Duncan are scheduled to testify on Monday before the Democratic-controlled House Oversight and Reform Committee, whose members have signaled interest in Mr. DeJoy’s hiring, the changes he enacted and Mr. Mnuchin’s involvement in the Postal Service. Kenneth Vogel, Alan Rappeport and Hailey Fuchs reported from Washington, and Jessica Silver-Greenberg from New York. Kitty Bennett contributed research."
"In early August, President Trump declared a plan to deliver $400 in extra weekly benefits to tens of millions of unemployed Americans — a short-term fix meant to replace the $600-a-week emergency federal supplement that expired in July.What is now clear is that the federal supplement is $300 a week, not $400. And few states have started paying out.Here is what we know.Most unemployed workers will get an extra $300 a week.The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which normally provides disaster relief, will provide $300 per recipient. An additional $100 was supposed to be supplied by states, but most are struggling to meet other expenses. Tax revenues have been sinking at the same time that costs — like precautions to curb the spread of the coronavirus — have soared. Ultimately the administration said the states’ basic benefit payments could be counted toward their $100 share.So far, only three states, Kentucky, Montana and West Virginia, have decided to supply the extra $100. Vermont’s plan to bring the total payment to $400 is awaiting approval from the state’s legislature. Kansas also has said it plans to supply the extra $100. Jobless workers with small unemployment benefits will not get the supplement.Only people who qualify for at least $100 per week in unemployment benefits — either through the regular state program or a federal pandemic assistance program — are eligible for the extra federal funds.In Colorado, for example, roughly 28,000 people, or about 6 percent currently receiving unemployment pay, will not receive the new benefit, said Cher Haavind, deputy executive director of the state Department of Labor. 47 states have signed on so far.As of Wednesday, funds had been approved for 47 states:AlabamaAlaskaArizonaArkansasCaliforniaColoradoConnecticutDelawareFloridaGeorgiaHawaiiIdahoIllinoisIndianaIowaKansasKentuckyLouisianaMaineMarylandMassachusettsMichiganMinnesotaMississippiMissouriMontanaNew HampshireNew JerseyNew MexicoNew YorkNorth CarolinaNorth DakotaOhioOklahomaOregonPennsylvaniaRhode IslandSouth CarolinaTennesseeTexasUtahVermontVirginiaWashingtonWest VirginiaWisconsinWyomingOne state has declined to take part. South Dakota’s governor, Kristi Noem, announced that her state would forgo the federal funds, saying they were not needed because South Dakota had recovered 80 percent of its job losses.That leaves two states that have not been approved: Nebraska and Nevada. Both states say they have applied. States have until Sept. 10 to apply for the funds.Payments could still be weeks away. Each state is supposed to administer the new supplement, just as it processes regular state unemployment insurance and federal pandemic jobless benefits.In the spring, when state unemployment systems were overwhelmed with claims, there were delays of weeks or even months because computer systems had to be updated and reprogrammed, and staff members trained.Now states must again work out how to process a new program while they keep existing benefits flowing. New claims for state jobless benefits unexpectedly jumped in the most recent weekly report to 1.1 million.On a conference call with reporters on Thursday, John P. Pallasch, assistant secretary for employment and training at the Labor Department, said it could take some states up to six weeks to figure out how to get a program up and running.On Aug. 17, Arizona became the first state to start paying out. By Wednesday, five additional states — Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Tennessee and Texas — had started paying out benefits, according to the Labor Department.Most states, however, said it could take until mid-September or later to reprogram computer systems and take other steps to get the money to recipients. Some states don’t expect to send out funds until early October. The extra benefit is likely to run out in September.To finance the program without a congressional appropriation, Mr. Trump set it up to draw from federal disaster funds — a limited pool — and the administration said that no more than $44 billion would be spent.According to estimates from FEMA and the Labor Department, that sum will cover four or five weeks of payments. The funds are supposed to be retroactive to Aug. 1, so recipients might be paid only through early September.Keith Turi, a FEMA official, said on the call on Thursday that the initial approvals were for three weeks. “We’ll add additional weeks from there as needed,” he said.Congress is at an impasse on longer-term support.Mr. Trump acted after Democrats and Republicans were unable to work out a deal on supplemental benefits before the August congressional recess. Democrats have steadfastly supported restarting the $600 weekly booster that ended last month. Republicans have pushed for a smaller supplement — initially proposing $200 a week, arguing that bigger sums discourage people from returning to work.Studies by economists across the political spectrum have concluded that the additional benefits have not deterred job seekers. The latest, by the Becker Friedman Institute for Research in Economics at the University of Chicago, found that despite anecdotal reports of people turning down jobs, “very few workers would not have returned to work” if given the opportunity. For most, the temporary nature of the supplement, the difficulty of finding another job, and concerns about career setbacks and permanently lower wages outweigh the short-term financial gain. And workers who reject job offers are no longer eligible for unemployment benefits.Nearly 30 million people are receiving some form of jobless benefits. At the end of June, there were roughly 5.9 million job openings.Economists say the emergency federal checks this year have kept the economy functioning, fueling spending that has supported restaurants, retailers and other businesses. The $600-a-week supplement injected roughly $70 billion a month into the economy between April and July, almost 5 percent of total household income.Nelson D. Schwartz contributed reporting."
"Lou Henson, who led New Mexico State and the University of Illinois to the Final Four in a 42-year head-coaching career in which he piled up almost 800 victories, died on Saturday at his home in Champaign, Ill. He was 88.Kent Brown, the associate director of athletics and media relations for the Illinois athletic department, confirmed the death on Wednesday, the same day the university said Henson was buried in a private ceremony.Henson learned he had non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in 2003 but continued to coach New Mexico State in the 2003-4 season. In September 2004 he was hospitalized with viral encephalitis, which left his right leg paralyzed, requiring him to use a wheelchair. In January 2005, two days before he was scheduled to return to lead the Aggies, he was hospitalized with pneumonia. Two weeks later, he retired. “I have always been a very demanding coach,” he said in announcing his retirement. “I expect my players to give 100 percent or they come out of the game. I can expect no less of myself, so because I am physically unable to give my all, I am taking myself out of the game.” Henson coached four seasons (1962-66) at Hardin-Simmons University in Texas, nine (1966-75) at New Mexico State and 21 (1975-96) at Illinois, before returning to Las Cruces, N.M., to coach the Aggies for eight more seasons (1997-2005).He had retired from the Illinois job, in Champaign, when he returned to New Mexico State to help rescue the basketball program. At the time, only one of the team’s players had graduated in five years, and the N.C.A.A. had put the team on probation.Henson took 19 teams to the N.C.A.A. tournament and four to the National Invitation Tournament. He reached the N.C.A.A.’s Final Four with New Mexico State in 1970 and with Illinois in 1989. A year after Illinois got there, it received severe penalties from the N.C.A.A. for recruiting violations.The Illinois team, led by the future professionals Kenny Battle, Kendall Gill, Nick Anderson and Stephen Bardo, racked up 31 wins in the 1988-89 season before losing to Michigan by two points in a Final Four semifinal game at the Kingdome in Seattle. (Michigan went on to win the title, beating Seton Hall.) Henson’s career coaching record was 779-413. When he retired, only four coaches (Dean Smith, Adolph Rupp, Bob Knight and Jim Phelan) had won 800 games in Division I, and only Knight was still coaching. Today, Henson is ranked 15th among coaches with the most career wins, 12 of whom have notched more than 800 victories. (Mike Krzyzewski, who is still active at Duke, has the most, 1,132.)Henson was named to the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in St. Louis in 2015, the same year the basketball court at the State Farm Center in Champaign was dedicated in his honor.Away from the court, Henson was genial and charming. On the court, he was all business, stressing defense, two-handed passes and conservative ball handling.“He’s an old-school guy, and he insisted on doing things soundly,” Derek Harper, an Illinois player who became an outstanding professional, told The Chicago Tribune in 1996. Eddie Johnson, another former player, said of Henson: “He never wavered in his demeanor. I think that’s what made him a great coach, because you always knew what to expect.” Louis Raymond Henson was born Jan. 10, 1932, in the small town of Okay, Okla., to Lora (Falconer) and Joe Henson, who were sharecroppers. One of eight children, he grew up in a house with no indoor plumbing.At New Mexico State, he earned a bachelor’s degree in secondary education in 1955 and a master’s in educational administration in 1956. A year later, he started his coaching career as the junior varsity coach at Las Cruces High School. He married Mary Brantner in 1954. His survivors include his wife and three daughters, Lori Henson, Lisa Rutter and Leigh Anne Edison; a sister, Rosemary Yates; a brother, Ken; 12 grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren. A son, Lou Jr., was the basketball coach at Parkland College, a community college in Champaign, when he was killed in an automobile accident in 1992.After his retirement, Henson split his time between Las Cruces and Champaign. A passionate bridge player, he participated in many local tournaments. In his later years, as he dealt with his lymphoma, he golfed and swam regularly.Henson was proud of his players’ post-collegiate achievements. He once said, “I have doctors, lawyers and business people all over the country.”He acknowledged the pressures of his job. “It’s not a normal profession,” he said. “If you don’t learn to live with it, you don’t coach.”Through all the late-hour demands, he found time for his growing daughters. Lori, the eldest, told The Chicago Tribune in 1995, “We lived our father’s career.” She added: “It’s part of your life. It surrounds you.”Leigh Anne, the youngest daughter, said that as a child she would draw basketball plays and leave them on her father’s desk.“After the game,” she said, “he would say, ‘Did you see that play of yours we used?’ And I’d say yes. I believed it for the longest time.”Frank Litsky, a longtime sportswriter for The Times, died in 2018. Julia Carmel contributed reporting."
"In April, Jay Wright, the men’s basketball coach at Villanova, worried the coronavirus pandemic would hurt his ability to recruit players from next year’s high school class.Because coaches could not watch players in person or have them visit their campuses that month, Wright was not sure how he and his staff would be able to properly evaluate the athletes.“If it affects us and hurts us a little bit, so what?” Wright said in April. “Suck it up. There’s a lot more important things going on in our world right now.”Three months later, his fears seem almost quaint.After two recent verbal commitments, Wright and his staff now have four rising seniors committed and thus the No. 1 recruiting class for 2021, according to the recruiting website 247Sports.com. They include players who could start in the future: point guard Angelo Brizzi of Virginia, shooting guard Jordan Longino of Pennsylvania, small forward Trey Patterson of New Jersey and the big man Nnanna Njoku of Delaware. Under Wright, Villanova has won two of the last four N.C.A.A. championships, and these players are eager to be a part of the growing tradition. “We don’t have A.A.U. this year, and normally we would be traveling and focusing on games,” Patterson, out of Rutgers Preparatory School, said Tuesday in a phone interview. “But because of the pandemic, me and my family, we’ve had more time to talk to schools and evaluate programs, so I think that kind of expedited the process.”In a normal summer, Patterson and many of the other top high school prospects would be out playing this month at the Nike Peach Jam in North Augusta, S.C., or at other events across the nation trying to impress coaches and attract scholarship offers.Now, with tournaments largely canceled because of the virus and the N.C.A.A. imposing a dead period for recruiting through at least August, Patterson verbally committed on June 18 and plans to sign his letter of intent in the fall.Several other schools are also benefiting. Baylor, Butler, Ohio State, Southern California, Louisville, Michigan and Florida State each had three players committed for 2021 as of Wednesday.“What’s really pushed up the whole recruiting process is the pandemic because kids are uncertain as to whether they’re ever going to be able to make paid visits to these schools, so they’ve had these virtual visits,” Tom Konchalski, a longtime recruiting expert, said in a phone interview. “Obviously, that doesn’t give them as much of a feel for the team, the campus, the coach, the players and the whole culture of the school as if they took a visit when school was actually in session. But it’s better than nothing.” Jeff Ngandu, a Canadian big man originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo, pledged to Seton Hall in May for the 2020-21 season without ever having visited the New Jersey school. Saquan Singleton similarly committed in April for 2020 to New Mexico out of Hutchinson (Kan.) Community College. Both stayed in touch with their future coaching staffs through videoconferencing and phone calls.“Unfortunately, I couldn’t get to see the visit but I just felt the love and the connection,” Singleton said.Jordan Riley, a rising senior guard at Brentwood High School on Long Island, committed on Friday to Georgetown after only a one-hour visit to the university this month with his father, Monty. They were not able to see any students or meet with the basketball team because the campus was closed. They did not even let Georgetown’s coach, Patrick Ewing, and his staff know they were on campus.Yet the visit — along with Ewing’s recruiting message on a daily basis — was enough to make the 6-foot-4, 185-pound guard pledge to the Hoyas over Kansas, Florida State, Connecticut and St. John’s. He had visited St. John’s and UConn, but was unable to visit the other campuses.“I saw the campus, I saw what I liked and I’m just ready to go there,” Riley said of Georgetown.Monty Riley said he wanted to speed up the process because he was being overwhelmed with calls that he normally would not have received in a nonpandemic year.“It was just too many phone calls,” Monty Riley said. “One day I got 30 phone calls. And I’m working. I made him shorten his list and made him go on from there.” Rising seniors and incoming college freshmen aren’t the only ones committing during the pandemic.Emoni Bates, the No. 1 prospect in the class of 2022 out of Michigan, verbally committed to Michigan State last month, more than two years before he will play his first college basketball game. That could change if Bates reclassifies into the 2021 class. And if the N.B.A.’s one-and-done rule is collectively bargained away by 2022, Bates, who has been compared to a young Kevin Durant, could just enter the N.B.A. draft in 2022 and skip college altogether. He could also forgo college, and make money, by entering the G-League’s pro pathway program for elite prospects.For now, though, his college decision has been made.“The pandemic had no influence over the timing of our Michigan State decision,” Elgin Bates, Emoni’s father, said in a text message. “We just chose to let it be known what we’ve been thinking since seventh grade at this time. There was no point in waiting or wasting anyone’s time recruiting.”Michigan State landed a second pledge in the junior class this week when center Enoch Boakye verbally pledged to Coach Tom Izzo’s team.Some college coaches and others in the game believe there could be another downside to these early commitments besides players changing their minds before officially signing. They’re bracing for more transfers — an interesting prospect considering there are already more than 1,000 players in the N.C.A.A. transfer portal.Patterson feels the early commitment will help Villanova and his future teammates in the long run, giving them more time to get to know one another and understand what they will expect from each other.“It’s good that we’re almost done with our class now and we have the opportunity to build relationships with each other over this next year before we come in and build a relationship with the coaches even more as well,” he said. “So everybody’s pretty much on the same page.”"
"College athletes who have asserted themselves in recent months on many issues, including social justice matters, the right to cash in on their fame, and improved health and safety conditions if they are to play football this fall during the pandemic, gained powerful backing on Wednesday with Democratic senators announcing a framework for a college athletes’ bill of rights that would support those causes.The proposal from Cory Booker of New Jersey has the backing of 10 other Democratic senators, including the presumptive vice-presidential nominee, Kamala Harris.Booker, a former football player at Stanford, said in a statement that the issue was personal to him and that the framework for future legislation would provide “fairness, equity and safety in college athletics, and holds colleges accountable to those standards.”The Senate judiciary and commerce committees have held hearings this year, questioning college leaders — including N.C.A.A. president Mark Emmert — about a variety of issues, asking how accommodating new rules on players making use of their name, image and likeness would be, and why some schools had required athletes to sign liability waivers when they returned to campus for workouts amid the coronavirus pandemic. The N.C.A.A. has also sought the help of Congress, saying it needs federal legislation — and an antitrust exemption — to streamline new rules to allow athletes to make deals. College sports administrators fear that states will impose their own laws instead, as California did in September, prompting more serious consideration of new rules.The N.C.A.A. has said its proposals will be presented to universities for a vote in January.Though there has been some Republican interest in these issues, any legislation to aid college athletes’ rights is unlikely to be taken up by the Republican-controlled Senate, especially before the November election, when Democrats hope to win back a majority of seats. But the backers of the framework said it was important to present it now.“We’re playing the long game,” Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, said in an interview.Blumenthal credited college athletes for raising their voices, the most recent example coming this month when players in several conferences have followed the lead of Pac-12 players who have asked for stronger, more uniform health and safety standards to play football this fall. The players also asked for a redistribution to earn some of the wealth that the multibillion-dollar college sports industry generates (college athletes compete for little more than scholarships).The senators hope to generate legislation that would bring more comprehensive health care coverage, more detailed public accounting of revenues and expenses, fewer restrictions on transfers, and an oversight panel of current and former college athletes, policy experts, academics and administrators. “My hope is that it will be embraced by the schools and the N.C.A.A. and others in power, and that they will be proactive and take voluntary action,” Blumenthal said. “But if not, Congress may need to act. And even if they do, Congress probably needs to act, because it will be the type of very fractionated decisions we’re seeing with playing football.”"
"Yes, these are hard times, and everyone is stressed, but new data suggest that young adults — both those who are going back to college and those who are not — may be suffering particularly hard when it comes to mental health.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently released survey data on adult mental health, looking at a national sample of adults during the last week in June. Unsurprisingly, the stress level is high, with 40.9 percent overall reporting at least one “adverse mental or behavioral health condition.”One question asked whether the person responding had seriously considered suicide in the past 30 days, and more than one in 10 respondents said yes, with higher percentages among unpaid adult caregivers, essential workers, and Hispanic and Black responders. And 25.5 percent of the young adults surveyed — the 18- to 24-year-olds — answered yes.The young adults also reported the highest levels of symptoms of anxiety and depression — 62.9 percent reported either or both. Their rates of having started or increased substance use to cope with pandemic-related stress or emotions was way up there as well at 24.7 percent (it was equal or higher only among the essential workers and the unpaid caregivers). In all, 74.9 percent of those 18 to 24 years old reported at least one bad symptom. So the young adults are definitely not OK. And interestingly, the occurrence of these symptoms decreased with increasing age; among the respondents 65 and up, who have their own set of anxieties to deal with, only 15.1 percent reported at least one of these symptoms.[Sign up for the Well Family newsletter]Rashon Lane, a behavioral scientist at the C.D.C. who was an author of the study, said symptoms of anxiety disorder and depressive disorder had increased significantly relative to 2019, with a disproportionate impact on young adults.It’s important to identify the populations at increased risk, Ms. Lane said, to provide them with services and support, and also to recognize that many people fall into more than one risk group — some young adults are also essential workers, members of the minority groups that are disproportionately bearing the brunt of the pandemic or people with pre-existing mental health conditions.Dr. Sarah Vinson, an associate professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at Morehouse School of Medicine, said that it’s normal for older adolescents and young adults to be thinking seriously about what they are going to do with their lives. “Maybe they’re not all anxious, but they’re all thinking about this and feeling uncertain about next steps,” she said.And now they find themselves going through this transition at a moment when the ground feels shaky. “The people they normally go to for advice haven’t gone through something like this before — parents, professors, mentors,” Dr. Vinson said. “Our college students are emerging adults,” said Betty Lai, an assistant professor of counseling psychology in the Lynch School of Education and Human Development at Boston College. At this age, you are still learning, still figuring things out as you go, she said, including what career you are going to pursue, and “who are the people you are going to have as part of your life long-term? All of these important developmental tasks come up.”The pandemic is changing their opportunities to figure out those issues, and also, of course, changing their opportunities to go to school, to see their friends, to live away from home.Dr. Lai studies mental health in the aftermath of disasters, like Hurricane Katrina or the Boston Marathon bombing. She said that in a recent study of college students, 91 percent reported moderate to high stress levels, and 39 percent reported moderate to severe anxiety, while 53 percent reported moderate to severe depression.The current pandemic, she said, is “a breeding ground for mental health disaster,” with unprecedented levels of risk factors. “This exposure period is prolonged, longer than anything we’ve seen before,” she said, and the social isolation makes everything worse.Some college students are going to be on campus this fall, but much of their learning will be remote, and they face strict safety rules limiting social activity. Other students face another semester of staying home. Either way, parents should be alert for signs of stress and isolation. Stressors are heightened, Dr. Vinson said, and many people find themselves without their usual coping strategies.This combination of uncertainty about their personal future and worry about the larger future can leave some people without much sense of hope or promise about what is coming next. “Hopelessness is one of the big drivers of suicide,” Dr. Vinson said. “It’s normally not about wanting to be dead; it’s about not wanting to live like this, whatever this is.”In addition, Dr. Vinson said, suicide risk can be related to impulsiveness, and “we know people will often act more impulsively if they are using substances, which exacerbate mental health issues.” Parents — or friends or family members — who are worried about young adults or adolescents should check in on them, ask how they’re doing, and should not worry that by asking about depression, mental health or suicide they are creating or exacerbating the problem..css-1xzcza9{list-style-type:disc;padding-inline-start:1em;}.css-1wxds7f{margin-bottom:10px;font-family:nyt-franklin,helvetica,arial,sans-serif;font-weight:700;font-size:0.875rem;line-height:1.25rem;color:#333 !important;}.css-1yyoic1{font-family:nyt-franklin,helvetica,arial,sans-serif;font-size:0.9375rem;line-height:1.25rem;color:#333;margin-bottom:0.78125rem;}@media (min-width:740px){.css-1yyoic1{font-size:1.0625rem;line-height:1.5rem;margin-bottom:0.9375rem;}}.css-zkk2wn{margin-bottom:20px;font-family:nyt-franklin,helvetica,arial,sans-serif;font-size:0.875rem;line-height:1.5625rem;color:#333;}.css-1dvfdxo{margin:10px auto 0px;font-family:nyt-franklin,helvetica,arial,sans-serif;font-weight:700;font-size:1.125rem;line-height:1.5625rem;color:#121212;}@media (min-width:740px){.css-1dvfdxo{font-size:1.25rem;line-height:1.875rem;}}#masthead-bar-one{display:none;}#masthead-bar-one{display:none;}.css-19mumt8{background-color:white;margin:30px 0;padding:0 20px;max-width:510px;}@media (min-width:740px){.css-19mumt8{margin:40px auto;}}.css-19mumt8:focus{outline:1px solid #e2e2e2;}.css-19mumt8 a{color:#326891;-webkit-text-decoration:none;text-decoration:none;border-bottom:2px solid #ccd9e3;}.css-19mumt8 a:visited{color:#333;-webkit-text-decoration:none;text-decoration:none;border-bottom:2px solid #ddd;}.css-19mumt8 a:hover{border-bottom:none;}.css-19mumt8[data-truncated] .css-rdoyk0{-webkit-transform:rotate(0deg);-ms-transform:rotate(0deg);transform:rotate(0deg);}.css-19mumt8[data-truncated] .css-eb027h{max-height:300px;overflow:hidden;-webkit-transition:none;transition:none;}.css-19mumt8[data-truncated] .css-5gimkt:after{content:'See more';}.css-19mumt8[data-truncated] .css-6mllg9{opacity:1;}.css-a8d9oz{border-top:5px solid #121212;border-bottom:2px solid #121212;margin:0 auto;padding:5px 0 0;overflow:hidden;}School Reopenings ›Back to SchoolUpdated Sept. 11, 2020The latest on how schools are reopening amid the pandemic.School officials in Des Moines are refusing to hold in-person classes, despite an order from Iowa’s governor and a judge’s ruling, risking school funding and their jobs because they think it’s unsafe.The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign had one of the most comprehensive plans by a major college to keep the virus under control.

Even people who are physically apart, Ms. Lane said, can “stay socially connected, checking in with friends and family often to talk about these concerns.”Parents don’t have to pretend to have answers. It’s fine to acknowledge your own worries and uncertainties, Dr. Vinson said; it’s important for young adults to understand that their parents haven’t got it all figured out — and that they’re willing to talk about it and try to work through their questions.Dr. Maya Haasz, an assistant professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, said that for the past few years, every child over age 10 who comes to the emergency room at Children’s Hospital Colorado, where she is an attending physician, is screened for suicide risk, using a questionnaire.“Somewhere between 5 and 10 percent of our patients presenting for nonmental health concerns screen positive,” she said — and this was true before the pandemic. Some of these children, who were perhaps coming in for injuries or abdominal pain, have needed to be hospitalized for mental health issues.Screening children for suicide risk in the emergency room also gives the staff a chance to talk with parents about how to make the home safe, Dr. Haasz said. “It gives us an opening to talk to parents about restricting lethal means,” she said. Try to make your home as safe as possible for someone who may be struggling. If you know — or suspect — that there have been issues with substance use, don’t keep liquor or leftover prescription medications around. “Guns are uniquely lethal,” Dr. Haasz said. “They’re used in 6 percent of attempts, but they account for 54 percent of deaths.” If suicide has been a concern, it’s especially important to get guns out of the home if possible, or at least to be sure they are safely locked up with the ammunition locked up separately.If you are having thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (TALK). The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration maintains a 24/7 helpline at 1-800-662-4357 (HELP). Rashon Lane, a behavioral scientist at the C.D.C., recommended the C.D.C. web page on stress and coping.

"Mammography is a valuable tool for finding breast cancer when it is still confined to the breast and highly amenable to cure. But no matter how good the odds for survival may be with early detection, I’m quite certain women would rather not develop breast cancer in the first place.Yet, even though one woman in eight will eventually receive a breast cancer diagnosis, only a minority currently take advantage of the well-established lifestyle measures for reducing chances of developing the disease, and far fewer take medications that can help prevent it in women at higher than average risk.Part of the problem may well be the confusion wrought by periodic reports of conflicting evidence for what raises — or lowers — a woman’s chances of developing breast cancer, ranging from the drugs she uses to the foods and beverages she consumes. Another inhibiting factor is the limited amount of time doctors can devote to assessing a woman’s risk of breast cancer and explaining the complex trade-offs involved in breast cancer prevention.In the latest report published in JAMA, experts at the University of California, San Francisco, reviewed compelling evidence for two classes of drugs normally prescribed following breast cancer treatment that can also help prevent cancer in some women not yet affected by this disease. One class consists of two drugs, tamoxifen and raloxifene, that inhibit the action of estrogen in selective tissues. The other consists of three aromatase inhibitors, anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole, that reduce the levels of circulating estrogen that could stimulate the growth of estrogen-sensitive breast cancers. Whether a woman might consider such drugs depends in part on lifestyle measures and medical history. Although some women may choose to ignore existing evidence and continue to do what they enjoy regardless of the associated risk, experts say women should at least be able to weigh their chosen behaviors against a raised breast cancer risk. Their decisions should also consider their personal health history and the ailments that run in their families to which they too may be susceptible.Consumption of alcohol is a classic example. Even a small amount of alcohol — less than one drink a day — can raise breast cancer risk, and the more a woman drinks, the greater her chances of developing this disease. A friend recently treated for an early-stage breast cancer quit drinking wine, which resulted in weight loss that may also reduce her risk of a new or recurring breast cancer.On the other hand, moderate consumption of alcohol, and wine in particular, is associated with a reduced cardiovascular risk, so if heart disease figures more prominently than cancer in your family, you may decide to have that daily glass of wine. With smoking, however, there is no health benefit, only risk — to your breasts as well as every major organ and your life.Another modifiable breast cancer hazard is being overweight, especially after menopause, when body fat becomes the major source of cancer-promoting hormones. The good news here is that the two measures that can help you lose excess weight — a healthy diet and regular physical activity — also protect against breast cancer and reduce the risk of heart disease.Strive for a mostly plant-based diet of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans and nuts; healthy sources of fats like olive and canola oil; and fish in lieu of red meat. And include a weekly minimum of two and a half hours of moderate physical activity, or 75 minutes of vigorous activity, plus strength training twice a week. Alas, two long-known protective factors — early childbearing (in the teens and 20s) and prolonged breastfeeding — run headlong into the life goals of many modern women who seek graduate degrees and professional advancement, as well as young women financially unable to support a family.Many older women run into another confusing and controversial decision: whether and for how long to take hormone therapy to counter life-disrupting symptoms of menopause. Barring an earlier history of breast cancer, current advice for women who have not had a hysterectomy is to take combination hormone therapy (that is, estrogen and a progestin) for as short a time as needed to control symptoms but no longer than a few years.A recent study, published July 28 in JAMA, described the long-term effects on breast cancer risk among 27,347 postmenopausal women randomly assigned to take hormone replacement or not. The authors, led by Dr. Rowan T. Chlebowski at UCLA Medical Center, reviewed the health status of the participating women more than two decades later.Among the 10,739 women who had no uterus and could safely take estrogen alone (progestin is typically added to prevent uterine cancer), menopausal hormone therapy significantly reduced their risk of developing and dying from breast cancer. However, among the 16,608 women with a uterus who took the combination hormone therapy, breast cancer incidence was significantly higher, although there was no increased risk of death from the disease.In commenting on these results, Dr. Christina A. Minami, a breast cancer surgeon at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and Dr. Rachel A. Freedman, an oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Center, wrote that the new findings “are unlikely to lead to the use of hormone therapy for the sole purpose of breast cancer risk reduction.”But Dr. Freedman said in an interview, “If I’m counseling a patient who’s really miserable with menopausal symptoms and is a candidate for estrogen only, these findings are reassuring that her breast cancer risk will not be any higher over time.”Then there’s the possibility of taking a daily drug to suppress a potential breast cancer in high-risk women who have not yet had the disease. Dr. Jeffrey A. Tice, an internist at the University of California, San Francisco, suggested that women’s doctors use one of the several risk assessment calculators to determine how likely the patient might be to develop breast cancer within the next five or 10 years. The United States Preventive Services Task Force concluded that the benefits of medication outweigh the risks for postmenopausal women with a 3-percent or greater chance of receiving a breast cancer diagnosis within five years.Starting at age 40, younger women with a strong family history of breast cancer and those who have had precancerous findings on a breast biopsy should consider preventive drug therapy, Dr. Tice and Dr. Yiwey Shieh suggested in JAMA. Dr. Tice said women in the top 5 percent of breast cancer risk for their age might also evaluate the benefit of preventive therapy and its possible risks, which can include blood clots or bone loss, depending on which drug is used.“Five years of therapy can reduce their breast cancer risk for up to 20 years,” he reported.This is the second of two columns on reducing breast cancer risk."
"Is riding an e-bike good exercise? Is riding an e-bike safe?With interest in and sales of pedal-assisted electric bikes surging during the pandemic, those questions share a growing urgency. Two timely and soothing new studies of e-bike riders’ exertions and injuries suggest that the answer to both questions can be a qualified yes, though anyone riding an e-bike needs to remain aware that the experience is certainly cycling with a kick to it.As most of us are likely aware, bike riding has become extremely popular and aspirational this year, since so many of us are otherwise housebound. Riding gets us outside, active and heading somewhere — anywhere — else. But it also involves distance, hills, wind and sometimes leaden legs, which can be daunting.Enter e-bikes. Short for electric bikes, these are road or mountain bikes with an added battery-powered motor that gooses our pedaling power. Most e-bikes fall into one of three types. Class 1 e-bikes provide assistance while you pedal, up to a top speed of 20 miles per hour. Class 2 models power your ride even if you are not pedaling, but click off at 20 miles per hour. And Class 3 e-bikes assist pedaling up to a top speed of 28 miles per hour. (Local regulations vary about which bikes are allowed on bike paths, trails or roads. For information about e-bike rules in your area, see https://peopleforbikes.org/our-work/e-bikes/.)Given their ability to help us cover multiple miles without requiring a spousal sag wagon, e-bikes sales have soared by 70 percent or more each month since the pandemic began, according to industry statistics. But this popularity may carry a price. Simon Cowell, the acerbic judge on “America’s Got Talent,” reported on Twitter he was hospitalized this month after fracturing his back during his first ride on a new electric trail bike, an exceptionally high-powered British version of an electric bicycle. Many of us have heard other (sometimes apocryphal) stories about e-bike accidents. And some people wonder if riding an e-bike, with its pedal assistance, even counts as a workout.On that last count, though, the first of the new studies is reassuring. Published in July in The International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, it involved 101 healthy adult men and women in Hamburg, Germany, who agreed to alternate riding either a standard bicycle or an e-bike over two separate two-week periods.Each volunteer chose his or her preferred e-bike model, with most picking road bikes having top assisted speeds of about 20 miles per hour. To compensate for the novelty factor, participants spent a couple of weeks getting used to their e-bikes before the study period. The researchers also provided their volunteers with activity monitors, heart rate monitors and a specialized phone app where the riders could record their trips, distance and how physically draining each ride had felt.The scientists did not offer their volunteers any suggestions, however, about where, when or how often to ride, says Hedwig Stenner, a research associate at the Institute of Sports Medicine at Hannover Medical School, who led the new study. The researchers wanted to see how people, on their own initiative, would use the different bikes and whether their riding would change with the e-bikes.Electric assistance did change their habits, the researchers found. In general, the men and women rode more often during the two weeks with e-bikes, averaging about five rides a week then, versus three a week with the standard cycles. Interestingly, the distances of most people’s rides did not budge, whichever type of bike they rode; their rides were not lengthier on the e-bikes, but they were more frequent. Their heart rates also differed. In general, people’s heart rates were about 8 percent lower when they pedaled e-bikes, but still consistently hovered within the range considered moderate exercise. As a result, during the two weeks when the volunteers rode e-bikes, they accumulated sufficient minutes of moderate physical activity to meet the standard exercise recommendation of 150 minutes of moderate activity. When they rode the standard bikes, they did not.Most also reported liking the pedal assist, Ms. Stenner says. More than two-thirds of the participants told the researchers they enjoyed the e-bikes and could imagine using them “for many years,” according to a final study questionnaire.But whether e-bikes might pose a greater risk for injuries than standard bicycles remains an open question. “No serious injuries were reported to us,” during the research, Ms. Stenner says.The other new study of e-bikes, which was published in December in Injury Prevention, is more cautionary, however. For it, researchers at New York University’s School of Medicine combed a national database of emergency room visits for information about accidents related to riding a standard bicycle, motorized scooter or an e-bike from 2000 to 2017.They found plenty of reports. More than nine million men, women and children showed up in an emergency room after being hurt while riding a standard bike during those 17 years. Another 140,000 injured themselves on scooters, and about 3,000 on e-bikes (an uncommon novelty in the early years of the study). In general, the e-bike injuries were the most severe and likely to require hospitalization.Why e-bikers tended to hurt themselves more seriously than other riders is not clear from the injury data, says Charles DiMaggio, an injury epidemiologist at NYU Langone Health, who led the new study. But speed likely played a role. “We know that e-bikes can go faster than traditional pedal cycles,” he says, unless you are a bike racer who bombs down hills at more than 20 or 30 miles per hour. “And we know that increased speed often results in more-severe injuries.”But there is encouraging news embedded within the injury statistics, he says. In the earliest years covered by the study, a majority of e-bike injuries involved children under age 18, who seem to have been the earliest adopters of this new cycling technology. The incidence among this group declined precipitously in the later years of the study, though, even as it rose among people aged 45 to 65. This shift could indicate that the younger riders became “more familiar” with how to ride e-bikes safely, Dr. DiMaggio says, a development that, with time and experience, should reduce injuries among other, older riders. Or the numbers could suggest that fewer young people are using e-bikes, leaving their parents or grandparents to be the ones now to try out e-bikes, and fall off them. In either case, though, the study’s takeaway is clear, Dr. DiMaggio says. Before venturing out onto roads or paths on an e-bike, “familiarize yourself with the bike,” he says. “Wear a helmet. Follow traffic rules. Don’t drink and ride.”More Tips on Riding an E-Bike SafelyE-bikes, at heart, are bikes, so if you can ride a bike, you can ride an e-bike. “You’ll just feel as if you have superhero legs” on the amplified, electric versions, says Ian Kenny, the e-bike brand leader for Specialized, a bike company that makes electric road and mountain bikes.E-bikes boost cycling speeds, though, so most new riders would benefit from some practice spins in a protected area with little traffic before venturing onto roads or paths, Mr. Kenny says. Look for a large, empty parking lot or a road closed to traffic during the pandemic for your first few rides.During these shakeout sessions, use your bicycle’s lowest assistance setting. (Different e-bikes offer different levels of pedal assistance.) “E-bikes accelerate faster” than standard bikes, Mr. Kenny points out, and that sudden momentum can disconcert and bobble unprepared riders.Practice slowing and braking, too. “Because e-bikes are heavier and travel faster, they will require more time and distance to stop” than a standard bike, Mr. Kenny says.When you do head for the open roads or paths, remember to monitor your battery life. The miles can slip by while your pedaling is aided, but the return trip will be long and grueling if you have drained your battery, especially since e-bikes, in general, are heavier than standard bicycles.Finally, wear a mask if you are around other riders and pedestrians, and perhaps add a jaunty bell to your bike, if it was not standard equipment. Sound it before passing anyone. “Treat others as you would like to be treated,” Mr. Kenny says. “It’s never fun to be startled by a zooming cyclist.”"
"No one else is going to say it, so allow me: 2004 was a good movie year. So good that this month’s edition of The Box is a sequel to last month’s. That one was set the late June weekend that “Fahrenheit 9/11” opened up top and “The Notebook” was still a sleeper. This one finds us in the first full weekend of August, when “Collateral” knocked “The Village” to second place.That year is appealing because it’s among the last to feature a strong mix of original ideas, major directors and stars we still wanted to see. This particular weekend drew me because that endangered mix includes a couple of grubby comedies (“Little Black Book,” with Brittany Murphy, and “Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle,” with John Cho and Kal Penn) and at least one star in something people went to see with their noses pinched. Time has been no kinder to “Catwoman.” It’s still a turkey whose meaning for Halle Berry is obvious. She’d recently made Oscar history; here she was, making superhero history — as “the first Black woman to …” The movie, though, which had sunk to No. 9 in its third week, doesn’t know what to do with the cats, let alone the Black woman hired to slink from screen saver to screen saver on their behalf.The superhero franchise was still just an element of our diet as opposed to the whole enchilada. The people who made “Catwoman” — the director was Pitof, a one-named French visual effects specialist who should not be trusted with stars — must have known superheroes were hypnotic: “Spider-Man 2” was a couple rungs above it, massively popular in its sixth week. But this was an era when you could still treat a superhero like she was going to White Castle, too. The movies in 2004 were alert to the wars the country had recently started without feeling beholden to depict them. Rue and fury had suffused the cinematic mood. So had paranoia. We were into it. Conspiracy and suspicion drives more than half this week’s movies. Matt Damon tries to solve the mystery of his memory in “The Bourne Supremacy.” Has the government programmed him to kill? Denzel Washington digs at the matter of Liev Schreiber’s sudden appearance on a presidential ticket in another version of “The Manchurian Candidate.” Who, in that movie, hasn’t the government programmed to kill? And in “I, Robot,” poor Will Smith zooms around an unconvincing future Chicago in even less convincing leathers, trying to figure out whether a fleet of mechanical helpers has also been … Programmed to Kill. “The Village” is what really brought me back to this week. It’s M. Night Shyamalan’s sixth movie and his fourth as superstar filmmaker. And it, too, seems paranoid, as worried in its storytelling as the action movies. I remember finding the absurdity of it outrageous even for him. But Shyamalan doesn’t leaven the stress with chase sequences and top-drawer, whole-dresser fist fights. He’d become the last filmmaker of the pre-streaming era to make himself the draw.This was another of his plot-twist puzzles; and, after “The Sixth Sense,” “Unbreakable” and “Signs,” people had arrived at “The Village” ready to solve it. I don’t watch movies that way. A director gives me a story, and I’ll do my best to go wherever he or she takes me. And where this one is going — ostensibly, anyway — is a New England-esque hamlet in the 1890s. The place runs on forbidding rules that all but begin, “Thou shall not.” Red has been banned. And crossing the village boundary into the woods will upset the creatures the village elders have ponderously named “Those We Don’t Speak Of.” But animals are being skinned and strewn about the land, and red paint slashes front doors. Seems like the creatures are already upset. But Shyamalan is smart. Fear of invaders provides the atmosphere; people are the problem. Hearts get broken, somebody’s almost murdered. At some point, a sightless member of the community has to journey beyond it for medicine. “The Village” was a hit. You can tell, though, that the plot twist infuriated more people than it intrigued. Its numbers were down a staggering 67 percent from its enormous opening weekend. No one seemed to have the urge to protect the ending from being ruined the way they did for “The Sixth Sense,” a movie that inspired people to scream “I haven’t seen it yet!” when even strangers were overheard yammering about it and practically mandated the spoiler alert. Crossword fanatics turn to Rex Parker’s blog for comfort and commiseration. In 2004, frustrated Shyamaniacs had nowhere comparable to go. The ending was too — what? — insulting, pretentious, illogical to spoil. In the last month, I’ve encountered enough people who haven’t seen “The Village” that I’m compelled to preserve the surprise. There’s more to it than Shyamalan’s trap door, anyway.The movie has a visual richness that rehooked me when I watched it again recently. Knowing the story’s conceit little diminishes Shyamalan’s skill in telling it. Roger Deakins’s cinematography frames shots through doors and windows; in one particularly deft move, through both. Christopher Tellefsen’s editing dances gracefully between excess and concision, between dream pacing and a nightmare’s rush. Shyamalan remains an underrated director of actors. Here, it’s William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Cherry Jones, Celia Weston, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, Judy Greer, Brendan Gleeson, Michael Pitt, a barely there Jesse Eisenberg, lots of children and Bryce Dallas Howard, whose way with confidence and vulnerability should’ve made her a bigger star than she became. (I blame her central spots in Lars von Trier’s American slavery screed, ""Manderlay,” and Shyamalan’s follow-up and first stinker, “The Lady in the Water” — which I like! — plus the arrival of the somehow gutsier Jessica Chastain.)“The Village” is a strange movie. It works as a yarn that’s no bigger or grander than it needs to be. It’s got some of “The Twilight Zone”— Shirley Jackson and Nathaniel Hawthorne, too. The film’s characters have given up on an America they say no longer feels safe and wind up becoming a danger to themselves all the same. We’d call them privileged now. Assessments of Shyamalan don’t tend to wade into his Indian-American identity because the films don’t insist upon it. But with this movie, he’s built a world in which his own appearance would create suspicion in the dramatization of the conceit. The movie, therefore, becomes a tragedy about whiteness and its desperate preservation. The world beyond the village borders threaten its sanctity. One thing that remains so satisfying about the movie now is the director’s confidence. He believed he could get away with this thing, and, largely, he does.You can see why Shyamalan was such a draw. The great pop directors know how to give us what we want without pandering to do it; and getting exactly what we want still manages to arouse surprise. Hitchcock, Spielberg, Tarantino; it’s early but Jordan Peele. Shyamalan was in good box-office company that week. That “Manchurian Candidate” remake, doing so-so in its second week, was Jonathan Demme’s. It’s all over the place and strangely dull in parts. The action and politics never congeal in the script, so Demme has to force them together. You don’t know what compelled him to take the movie on, aside from the chance to work with Washington again and with Meryl Streep, who plays the scheming, gorgon mother. Demme guided one of Washington’s most sophisticated performance (in 1993’s “Philadelphia”) but his star barely comes through here. Watchful passivity is something a star like Damon can do (he’s used to having to find other ways to get noticed in a scene). But Washington can’t do small because he’s not. And so when he sits around, so does the movie. Demme was coming off pouring a lot of his soul into an impossible adaptation of Toni Morrison’s “Beloved,” from 1998, with Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, Kimberly Elise and Thandie Newton, and throwing a lot of confetti around “The Truth About Charlie,” a terrific, tremendously alive remake of Stanley Donen’s “Charade” with Newton and Mark Wahlberg. Both movies were received as misbegotten even though each has its considerable strengths, namely Elise and especially Newton, who was beguilingly weird in one and incandescent in the other. It’s possible that, by the time of this other, higher-stakes remake, Demme was just out of gas. You wonder what Paul Greengrass’s hyperkinetic, docu-realist style would have made of the same material had he not been tied up with the “Bourne” films. Instead, Greengrass was leading franchise violence into headier, more breakneck territory. He and Sam Raimi, who brought some love of B-movie splatter to the “Spider-Man” series, were trying to point Hollywood toward a harmonious bond between “visionary” and “pop,” to prove that the so-called auteurs could make assembly-line smashes with a signature. Early that summer, Alfonso Cuarón had helped underscore that point with his installment of the “Harry Potter” saga. But at some point, the franchises became the auteurs just as the superheroes and villains became the stars. It would’ve been impossible to assert a trademark style upon worlds that come preassembled without one. Shyamalan could sense as much. He used “Unbreakable,” “Split” and “Glass” to build his own superhero trilogy.The lasting cautionary lesson might not be Greengrass’s or Raimi’s. It’s probably that of Pitof. “Catwoman” was bungled from start to finish because all the vision was in the wrong places. The movie seemed to know it was an allegory for prematurely discarded female stars (Sharon Stone — casually invested, secretly campy — torments Halle Berry) but couldn’t conjure the outrage or concern for their plight the way Tim Burton did for Catwoman in his second “Batman” movie. Pitof evidently cared about the look, and even then his vision was impaired. The movie’s failure encouraged Hollywood to conclude that women make lousy subjects for superhero adaptations and that Berry should be hung out to dry. I left a second helping wondering why nobody could find a less lousy director. I won’t suggest that Michael Mann might have been such a person. But even just a touch of his rigor with action sequences, atmosphere and, yes, comedy could have saved the day for Berry. That rigor is all over “Collateral,” a shoot-’em-up that Stuart Beattie wrote in which a taxi driver (Jamie Foxx) chauffeurs an assassin (Tom Cruise) around Los Angeles as he crosses names off his hit list.Foxx does the driving under smoldering duress. Cruise does the killing under a block of ashen hair. They’re fantastic, and so is every sequence, nearly each shot and song selection. Mann was working with high-definition video, by Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron, that lent a matte painterliness to the images. The movie is set between dusk and dawn, and the light on Foxx’s dark brown skin and Cruise’s hair and matching suit turn them spectral.“Collateral” opens with a borderline romance between the cabbie and one of those high-powered attorneys (Jada Pinkett Smith). She exits his cab for a late work night until the movie finds a plausible excuse to revisit her. The hitman-protagonist conventions are here: Cruise is heartless (and unkillable) except for the occasional cloud breaks of camaraderie and humor. He’s operating at a grave extreme of the narcissistic rectitude of his other roles. He’s as sharply dialed in as the photography. Foxx is also in a zone — this is a star who can play small and gather strength as he shrinks. He was Academy Award-nominated for his work here. His performance as Ray Charles was about to win him an Oscar. Nonetheless, can a well-decorated actor be underrated? He should have four more.Mann had made a summer movie that felt like winter. It’s sexy, tense, handsome, off-kilter, suspenseful, soulful yet chilly, a prelude to his sweltering, erotic feature-length re-imagination of “Miami Vice,” with Foxx and Colin Farrell. “Collateral” follows “Ali,” a hefty biopic ultimately focused on the Rumble in the Jungle. That film might have been too besotted to work. But there’s something poignantly fantastical about Mann’s assertions of Black humanity. Has any Black man in an American movie had as many close calls with the police as Foxx in “Collateral” and still be alive and free by the end? And the final shot, of two people seeing day break, feels perversely decadent. Of course, Cruise’s contract killer loves jazz. So this is also a movie in which he blows out the brains of a Black trumpeter and club owner (Barry Shabaka Henley) for failing his lethally subjective Miles Davis trivia night.The movie might have been less than what audiences were looking for. Two hours of nasty Tom Cruise? It opened just under $25 million. Great for a Jamie Foxx movie back then, underwhelming for Cruise. I might have been part of the problem. At the end of that year, I made a Top 10 list and put 22 movies on it. None was “The Village” or “Collateral.” That was 2004 for you: treasure just left sunk."
