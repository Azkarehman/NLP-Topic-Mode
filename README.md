# NLP-Topic-Modeling

In natural language processing, the term topic means a set of words that “go together”.These are the words that come to mind when thinking of this topic. Take sports. Some such words are athlete, soccer, and stadium.
A topic model is one that automatically discovers topics occurring in a collection of documents. A trained model may then be used to discern which of these topics occur in new documents. The model can also pick out which portions of a document cover which topics.

I extracted news from The News and modeled their topics.

I followed the following steps for this task:
- Data extraction
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Application of a model
- Sharing insights
